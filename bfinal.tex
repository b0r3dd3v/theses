\oldchapter{About the author}

Bas Westerbaan, born in 1988,
    enrolled to the Radboud Universiteit
     as a physics student in 2007.
He received his bachelor's degree in
    mathematics with a thesis on computability theory
    supervised by~dr.~Wim Veldman.
He continued his study of logic and foundational computer science
    during his master's eduction and developed a keen interest for,
     what he thought to be, an unrelated mathematical field:
        functional analysis.
These interests however, are conveniently combined in the present thesis
    which continues the research of his master's thesis,
    which was supervised by prof.~Bart Jacobs as well.
During his undergraduate studies,
    Bas also served as secretary of the board of the 150 member student club
        Karpe Noktem and he was elected to
        the student board of the faculty of science.
His master's degree in mathematics was awarded cum laude in 2013.

While perfoming the research as a \emph{promovendus}
    at the Digital Security group that led to this thesis,
    Bas coauthered several security audits
        including those of the \emph{DigiD-} and \emph{BerichtenBox}-app;
        the Dutch digital identity and mail system. 
In the year between the submission and defense
    of his thesis, Bas was employed as a post-doctoral researcher
    where he assisted with the development of a cryptographic system
    for polymorphic pseudonymisation and encryption.
During that same year he also taught a quarter-year course on
    computer networking
        and was kindly invited by dr.~Heunen
        to speak about his research at the University of Edinburgh.
