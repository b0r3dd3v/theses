* Changed the formulation of Tomiyama's theorem (128II),
    added a remark about this (128IIa), and added a proof
    (changing 128III).
    
    As a result, 128VI and 128VII had to be changed slightly.

* Added a proof of Russo--Dye's theorem (34a), and adapted
  128IV,V,VII accordingly.

* Added an example in 84a showing that not all equalisers in CStarPU exist,
  and changed 10IX accordingly.
