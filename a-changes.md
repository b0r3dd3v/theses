Major additions:

* Changed the formulation of Tomiyama's theorem (128II),
    added a remark about this (128IIa), and added a proof
    (changing 128III).
    
    As a result, 128VI and 128VII had to be changed slightly.

* Added a proof of Russo--Dye's theorem (34a), and adapted
  128IV,V,VII accordingly.

* Added an example in 84a showing that not all equalisers in CStarPU exist,
  and changed 10IX accordingly.

* Changed point 119V (showing that several categories of von Neumann algebras
  are symmetric monoidal endowed with the tensor product) from an
  exercise to a theorem.  To this end I changed 119IV accordingly,
  and added  119IVa-c.

Major corrections:

* Corrected an error in 119IV(1) and 119V: when S and T are ultraweakly dense
  in A and B, resp., then S(x)T need not be ultraweakly dense in A(x)B.
  The conclusion should have been the linear span S(x)T is ultraweakly
  dense in A(x)B.

Small changes:

* Added a remark, 22IIa, on other interpretations of the word "order ideal".

* Added a remark, 96Ia, on the choice of 'filter'.

* Added a remark, 101Ia, on the use of the symbol \diamond.

* Added a warning on 'normal bilinear maps' in 102IIa.

* Added more examples of central similarity in 104III2a.

* Attributed Lemma 125IV to Kornell.

* Added definitions for := and \equiv in 1Va.

* Replaced "c.q.".

* Added a parenthetical remark in 44XV.

* Added the first line of 45III.

* Added an exercise 43Ia on filtered infima in a von Neumann algebra.

* Added an introductory remark, 116IIIa, to 116IV.

* Fixed various typos and other small errors.
