What offers this thesis?
Proof, perhaps,
to the manuscript committee
of passable academic work;
an advertisement, as it may be,
of my schools perspective
to colleagues;
a display, even,
of intellectual achievement
to friends and family.
But I believe such narrow and selfish goals \emph{alone}
barely serve to keep a writers spirits 
energized---and are definitely detrimental to the readers'.
That's why I've foolheartedly
challenged
myself
not just 
to dryly list contributions,
but to write this thesis
as the introduction
to the  area of research
that I would have liked to read
when I entered it back in May~2013.
Since at that time
I knew next to nothing 
about operator algebras---the mathematical basis
of my work---the preliminaries,
two chapters,
span two-thirds
of this thesis
and introduce you
to the theory  $C^*$-algebras
and von Neumann algebras,
respectively,
while the last chapter
contains proper original research.
For the first
two chapters I have not just mixed
and matched
relevant results from the literature,
but I have retailored the 
whole theory
from the shoes up
including proofs\footnote{Except for two results needed
at the very end.}in the best fashion
I could manage.
