\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{point}
What doesthis thesis offer?
Proof, perhaps,
to the manuscript committee
of passable academic work;
an advertisement, as it may be,
of my school's perspective
to colleagues;
a display, even,
of intellectual achievement
to friends and family.
But I believe such narrow and selfish goals \emph{alone}
barely serve to keep a writer's spirits 
energized---and are definitely detrimental to that of the readers.
That is why I have foolheartedly
challenged
myself
not just 
to dryly list contributions,
but to write this thesis 
as the introduction
that I would have liked to read
when I started
research for this thesis
back in May~2014.

The topic is von Neumann algebras,
the category they form,
and how they may be used
to model aspects of quantum computation.
Let us just say for now that a von Neumann algebra
is a special type of complex vector
space endowed with
a multiplication operation among some other additional structure.
An important example is the complex vector space~$M_2$
of~$2\times 2$ complex matrices,
because it models (the predicates on) a qubit;
but all~$N\times N$-complex matrices form a von Neumann algebra~$M_N$ as well.
Using von Neumann algebras
(and their little cousins, $C^*$-algebras) 
to describe quantum data types
has two distinct features.
Firstly, classical data types
are neatly incorporated:
$\C^2 \equiv \C\oplus \C$
models a bit,
and the direct sum $M_2\oplus M_3$
models the union type of a qubit and a qutrit.
Secondly,
von Neumann algebras
allow for infinite data types as well
	such as~$\scrB(\ell^2(\Z))$,
which represents a ``quantum integer.''\footnote{Though
	other methods of modeling infinite dimensional
	quantum computing have been proposed as well, e.g. \TODO{non-standard}
	\TODO{sam and mathys}, \TODO{models of qlc}.}
It should be said that this last feature
is both a boon and a bane:
it brings with it all the inherent
intricacies of dealing with infinite dimensions;
and it is no wonder that
most authors choose 
to restrict themselves
to finite dimensions,
especially since
this seems to be enough to describe quantum algorithms.

In this thesis, however,
we do face infinite dimensions,
because the two main results demand it:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
For the first result,
that von Neumann algebras
form  a model of Selinger and Valirons quantum lambda calculus,
as Cho and I explained in~\TODO{...},
and for which I'll provide the foundation here,
we need to interpret function types,
some of which are essentially infinite dimensional.
\item
The second result,
an axiomatization
of the map $a\mapsto \sqrt{p}a\sqrt{p}\colon \scrA\to\scrA$
representing measurement
of an element $p\in[0,1]_\scrA$
of a von Neumann algebra~$\scrA$
was tailored by B.E.~Westerbaan (my twin brother) and myself to work for
both finite and infinite dimensional~$\scrA$.
\end{enumerate}
These results
are part of a line of research that
tries to find patterns
in the category of von Neumann algebras,
that may also be cut from other categories
modelling computation---ideally in order to arrive at categorical axioms
for computation in general.
When I joined the fray
the notion of \emph{effectus} had already
been established by Jacobs,
and the two results
above offer potential additional axioms.
The work in this area has largely been a collaborative effort,
primarily between Jacobs, Cho, my twin brother, and myself,
and many of their insights have ended up in this thesis.

Of this I'd say no more
than that my work appears conversely, and proportionally,
in their writings too, except that the close cooperation
with my brother begs further explanation.
Our efforts on certain topics have been like interleaving 
of the pages of two phone books:
separating them  would be nigh impossible,
especially the work on the axiomatization
of~$a\mapsto \sqrt{p}a\sqrt{p}$ and Paschke dilations.
So that's why we decided to write our theses
as two volumes of the same work;
preliminaries on von Neumann algebras,
and the axiomatization of $a\mapsto \sqrt{p}a\sqrt{p}$
appear in this thesis,
while the work on dilations,
and effectus theory appear in my bother's thesis.

The results mentioned above only
make up 
about a third of this thesis;
the rest of it is devoted to 
the introduction to the theory of von Neumann algebras
needed to understand these results.
My aim is that anyone 
with, say, a bachelor's degree in mathematics
(c.q.~basic knowledge of linear algebra,
analysis, topology and set theory)
should at least be able to follow the lines of reasoning
with only minimal recourse to external sources.
But I hope that they will gain some deeper understanding
of the material as well.
To this end, and because I wanted to gain some of this insight
for myself too,
I've not just mixed
and matched
results from the literature,
but I tailored a thorough treatise
of everything that's needed,
including proofs.
Whenever possible,
I've taken shortcuts
(e.g.~avoiding for example
the theory of Banach algebras
and locally convex spaces entirely)
to  prevent the mental tax
the added concepts
(and pages) would have brought.
For the same reasons
I've refrained from putting
everything in its proper abstract (categorical) context
trusting that it'll shine through of its own accord.
I've however not been able to restrain
myself in making perhaps frivolous variations on the existing
theory whenever not strictly necessary,
taking for example Kadison's characterization
of von Neumann algebras
as my definition,
and developing the elementary theory for it;
in my defense I'll just say this adds to
the original element that is expected of a thesis.
\end{point}
\begin{point}[on-writing-style]
Finally, some words on the writing style.
I've replaced page numbers by
paragraph numbers
such as~\sref{on-writing-style}
for this paragraph.
The numbers after~\sref{conclusion} refer to paragraphs
	in my twin brother's thesis\TODO{citation}.
\Define{Definitions}\index{definitions} are set like that
(i.e..~in blue),
and can be found in the index.
Proofs of certain facts
that are easily obtained on the back of an envelope,
and would clutter this manuscript,
have been left out.
Instead these facts have been phrased as excercises
as a challenge to the reader.
